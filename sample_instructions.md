### How to Display the Value Assigned to a Python Variable

1. Define a variable named `message`.
```python
# Defining a variable named message
message
```
2. Use the assignment operator (=) to assign a string -- a piece of text -- to the variable.
3. Remember to enclose the text in a pair of single (or double) quotation marks, like so:
```python
message = 'Python is my favorite programming language!'
```
3. Type the name of the variable in the parentheses following the word print in the `print( )` function.
```python
print(message)
```
4. When you run your script, your output will look like this:
```python
Python is my favorite programming language!
```
